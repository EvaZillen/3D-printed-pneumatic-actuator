## Appendix - Compressed air-chamber
Here the different additive manufacturing methods are evaluated on the ability to hold pressure in a printed compressed-air chamber. 

### Code
Simply run `jupyter notebook` in this folder to view the interactive Notebooks

As alternative, the scripts can be run with native Python by `python3 appendix_compressed-air_chambers.py`

### Data
All the data used in this research is collected with our own experimental test setup. 
The data for these tests were initially collected as a `.xlsx` files. These have been converted to `.csv` files, to make data processing easier.

#### Data headers
Each `.csv` consists of the following three columns: 
| Time (in ms) | Pressure (in V) | Pressure (in bar) |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
